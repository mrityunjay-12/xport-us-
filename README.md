# Xportus Admin – Export-Import Dashboard (React + Tailwind)

A production-ready admin dashboard tailored for export–import (EXIM) businesses. Built on top of the TailAdmin React starter, this project adds opinionated EXIM workflows like Rate Search, Custom Rate Requests, Quotes, and Quote Approvals—with clean UI, dark mode, and accessible overlays.

Free, fast, and easy to customize. Ship real ops tools without reinventing the UI.

## Overview

Xportus Admin provides end-to-end UI scaffolding for freight teams and forwarders:

Search & Quote flow: search rates → request custom rates → quote → approval.

Team workflows: assign to Sales / Pricing, convert to quote, lock quotes, and send to customers.

Modern UX: portal-based drawers/modals, dark mode, responsive layouts.

Built with: React 19 • TypeScript • Tailwind CSS (v4).

The codebase keeps TailAdmin’s simplicity while layering in EXIM-specific screens and patterns you can plug into your APIs.
